/*
Software Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software design and development. They provide proven, standardized approaches to solving specific design challenges, making software more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

Types of Software Design Patterns:

1. Creational Patterns:

- Singleton: Ensures a single instance of a class.
- Factory: Provides a way to create objects without specifying exact classes.
- Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects.
- Builder: Separates object construction from representation.
- Prototype: Creates new objects by copying existing ones.

2. Structural Patterns:

- Adapter: Converts one interface to another.
- Bridge: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- Composite: Treats individual and composite objects uniformly.
- Decorator: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to complex systems.
- Flyweight: Reduces memory usage by sharing objects.
- Proxy: Controls access to an object.

3. Behavioral Patterns:

- Interpreter: Defines a grammar for a language.
- Iterator: Accesses elements without exposing underlying structure.
- Mediator: Encapsulates interactions between objects.
- Memento: Captures and restores object states.
- Observer: Notifies dependent objects of changes.
- State: Allows objects to change behavior when internal state changes.
- Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms.
- Template Method: Defines a skeleton for algorithms.
- Visitor: Performs operations on objects without modifying them.

4. Architectural Patterns:

- MVC (Model-View-Controller): Separates concerns in user interface development.
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter): Variants of MVC.
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates presentation logic.
- Repository: Abstracts data access and storage.
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Structures applications as services.

5. Enterprise Patterns:

- Data Access Object (DAO): Encapsulates data access.
- Service Locator: Provides a way to access services.
- Business Delegate: Encapsulates business logic.
- Value Object: Represents immutable data.

6. Real-Time Patterns:

- Reactor: Handles events and callbacks.
- Proactor: Initiates actions and handles responses.

7. Concurrency Patterns:

- Active Object: Encapsulates concurrent behavior.
- Monitor: Synchronizes access to shared resources.

8. Distributed Patterns:

- Broker: Facilitates communication between components.
- Proxy: Controls access to remote objects.

Benefits of Software Design Patterns:

- Improved code readability and maintainability.
- Enhanced flexibility and scalability.
- Reduced development time and costs.
- Promotes best practices and design principles.
- Facilitates communication among developers.

When to use Software Design Patterns:

- Complex systems with multiple components.
- Large-scale applications with varying requirements.
- Systems requiring high maintainability and scalability.
- Teams with diverse experience and skills.
- Projects with tight deadlines and limited resources.

Remember, design patterns are not:

- Silver bullets for all problems.
- Rigid templates.
- Language-specific.

Apply patterns judiciously, considering project needs and trade-offs.
