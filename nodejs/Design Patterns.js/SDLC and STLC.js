What is the difference between software life cycle and software process ?



SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) are two distinct processes in software development.

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

SDLC is a framework used to plan, design, develop, test, and deliver software applications. It encompasses all aspects of software development, from requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance.

    Phases of SDLC:

        1. Requirements Gathering
        2. Analysis
        3. Design
        4. Implementation (Coding)
        5. Testing
        6. Deployment
        7. Maintenance

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

    STLC is a subset of SDLC, focusing specifically on testing activities. It ensures that software meets requirements, works as expected, and is free from defects.

    Phases of STLC:

        1. Test Planning
        2. Test Case Development
        3. Test Environment Setup
        4. Test Data Preparation
        5. Test Execution
        6. Test Reporting
        7. Test Closure

Key differences:

1. Scope: SDLC covers the entire software development process, while STLC focuses solely on testing.
2. Objective: SDLC aims to deliver a working software application, whereas STLC aims to ensure the software meets requirements and is defect-free.
3. Phases: SDLC has broader phases, including design, implementation, and deployment, whereas STLC has testing-specific phases.
4. Activities: SDLC involves coding, design, and deployment, whereas STLC involves testing, test planning, and test reporting.
5. Timeline: SDLC spans the entire project duration, whereas STLC typically occurs after coding is complete.
6. Deliverables: SDLC produces a working software application, whereas STLC produces test reports, test cases, and defect reports.

In summary:

SDLC is the overall process of developing software, while STLC is a critical component of SDLC, focusing on testing and quality assurance.
