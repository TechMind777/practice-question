/*
 Composition in Node.js refers to the practice of building complex functionality by combining simpler, independent functions or modules together. Instead of relying on inheritance (common in object-oriented programming), composition allows you to create more flexible and reusable code by combining smaller pieces of functionality.


Key Concepts of Composition:
    Modularity: Functions or modules do one thing and do it well.
    Reuse: Combine existing functions or modules to create new functionality without modifying them.
    Flexibility: Change or extend behavior by combining functions differently, rather than altering the existing codebase.
