/*
NPM and NPX are both tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes.

1. NPM (Node Package Manager):
    Purpose: NPM is used for managing packages (libraries or dependencies) for Node.js projects.

    Main Functions:
        Install packages (npm install package-name)
        Manage project dependencies (package.json)
        Publish packages to the NPM registry.

    Example:
        npm install react

2. NPX (Node Package Executor):
    Purpose: NPX is a tool for executing Node.js packages without having to install them globally.

    Main Functions:
        Run a package directly from the NPM registry without installation.
        Helps avoid global installations by executing the latest package version.

    Example:
        npx create-react-app my-app

    Key Differences:
        NPM installs and manages packages, while NPX executes packages directly without requiring installation.
        NPX is useful for running one-time commands, whereas NPM is for long-term dependency management.
