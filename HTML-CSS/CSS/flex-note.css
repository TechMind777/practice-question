flex-direction 

	The flex-direction property in CSS Flexbox defines the main axis direction along which flex items are arranged. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the options:

	row: Aligns items in a horizontal row, from left to right (default).
	row-reverse: Aligns items in a horizontal row, but in reverse order, from right to left.
	column: Aligns items in a vertical column, from top to bottom.
	column-reverse: Aligns items in a vertical column, but in reverse order, from bottom to top.
	Usage: Use row and row-reverse for horizontal layouts, and column and column-reverse for vertical layouts, depending on the desired order and axis.






flex: 1 1 0 // == flex: 1 --> it is short hand

flex-grow: Controls how much a flex item can grow relative to others when extra space is available. A higher value means the item will take more space proportionally.

flex-shrink: Dictates how much a flex item can shrink relative to others when space is limited. A higher value means the item will shrink more compared to others.

flex-basis: Defines the default size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking happens. It can be a specific value (e.g., 200px) or auto.

justify-content: the justify-content options in CSS Flexbox, which align items along the main axis:

	flex-start: Aligns items to the start of the container (default for flex containers).
	flex-end: Aligns items to the end of the container.
	center: Centers items along the main axis.
	space-around: Adds equal space around items, with half-sized space on each end.
	space-between: Distributes items with equal space between, with no extra space at the ends.
	space-evenly: Distributes items with equal space between and on the ends.
	stretch: Not used with justify-content, but stretches items in cross-axis alignment.
	Non-Flexbox-specific options
	start and end: Align items at the start or end of the container based on the text direction.
	left and right: Align items to the left or right of the container (considering direction).
	normal: Resets alignment to the default based on the container's layout model.


 align-items options in CSS Flexbox, which align items along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis):

	These properties are often used to control vertical alignment in row-based flex layouts and horizontal alignment in column-based flex layouts.
	
	stretch: Stretches items to fill the container along the cross-axis (default behavior for flex containers).
	flex-start: Aligns items at the start of the cross-axis.
	flex-end: Aligns items at the end of the cross-axis.
	center: Centers items along the cross-axis.
	baseline: Aligns items along their first baseline (useful for aligning text across items).
	last baseline: Aligns items along their last baseline (less commonly used than baseline).
	Non-Flexbox-specific options
	start and end: Align items to the start or end of the cross-axis based on the writing mode.
