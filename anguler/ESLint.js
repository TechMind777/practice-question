ESLint is a popular open-source tool that helps developers identify and fix problems in their JavaScript (and TypeScript) code. It's primarily used to ensure code quality, maintain consistency, and follow coding standards by enforcing a set of rules defined either by default or customized by the project team.

Key Features of ESLint

    - Linting: Analyzes the code to find syntax errors, potential bugs, and non-adherence to coding standards.
    - Customizable Rules: You can define or modify rules based on your project's requirements, including best practices or team-specific guidelines.
    - Plugins: Extend ESLint's functionality for frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue and for languages like TypeScript.
    - Automatic Fixes: ESLint can automatically fix some issues, such as formatting and minor code issues, making it easier to maintain a clean codebase.
    - Integrates with IDEs: ESLint works with various IDEs (like VS Code, WebStorm, etc.), showing linting errors and warnings as you type.
