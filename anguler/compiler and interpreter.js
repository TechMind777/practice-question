/*
What is a difference between compiler and interpreter?
Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs. 

Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.

What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreter?
A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
