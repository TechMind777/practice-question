What is Props Drilling?

    Props drilling refers to the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through multiple layers of intermediary components. In React, props are the primary way to pass data and functionality from one component to another, but when the data needs to be passed through several levels, this process can become cumbersome and difficult to manage.
